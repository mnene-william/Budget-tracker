budget-tracker

I made a budget-tracker that enables users to input both expense and income transactions. The balance is displayed and updated dynamically using JavaScript.

 As I made this project, I learnt/improved in  the use of:
  Formatters such as the numberFormatter which I used to set the currency to Kenyan Shilllings,
  LocalStarage to store user input,
  Templete literals,
  EventListeners, and functions

 Additionally, I experienced several challenges such as; 
   Making the filter buttons functional,
   Displaying and updating the account balance dynamically, and
   making the delete button functional.
